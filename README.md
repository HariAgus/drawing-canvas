Drawables overview
When you need to display static images in your app, you can use the Drawable class and its subclasses to draw shapes and images. A Drawable is a general abstraction for something that can be drawn. The various subclasses help with specific image scenarios, and you can extend them to define your own drawable objects that behave in unique ways.

There are two ways to define and instantiate a Drawable besides using the class constructors:

Inflate an image resource (a bitmap file) saved in your project.
Inflate an XML resource that defines the drawable properties.
